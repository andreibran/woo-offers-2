# PRD: Woo Offers - WordPress Native Architecture Refactoring

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Document Title and Version
* PRD: Woo Offers - WordPress Native Architecture Refactoring  
* Version: 2.0 (Refactoring Release)

### 1.2 Product Summary
This PRD outlines the refactoring of Woo Offers from a React-based administrative interface to a WordPress-native implementation using standard WordPress admin patterns, WP_List_Table, Settings API, and traditional PHP-based admin pages. 

The refactoring maintains all core functionality while significantly reducing complexity, improving maintainability, and following WordPress coding standards. The new architecture eliminates build dependencies (webpack, npm, babel), reduces debugging complexity, and provides immediate functionality without compilation steps.

The refactored plugin will deliver the same powerful upselling capabilities with a simplified, more accessible codebase that follows WordPress best practices and integrates seamlessly with the WordPress admin experience.
