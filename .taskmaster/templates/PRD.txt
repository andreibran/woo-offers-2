# PRD: Woo Offers v3.0 - Complete Refactoring with Campaign System

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Document Title and Version
* PRD: Woo Offers v3.0 - Complete Architecture Refactoring and Campaign System
* Version: 3.0 (Major Refactoring Release)

### 1.2 Product Summary
This PRD outlines the complete refactoring of Woo Offers into a robust upsell/cross-sell campaign solution inspired by FunnelKit's architecture and workflow patterns. The refactoring transforms the plugin from a basic offer system into a professional campaign management platform with modern architecture, enhanced security, optimized performance, and intuitive user experience.

The new version introduces a campaign-based workflow with wizard-driven creation, comprehensive analytics, A/B testing capabilities, and multiple campaign types (checkout upsells, cart upsells, product page upsells, exit-intent, and post-purchase offers).

### 1.3 Key Problems Being Solved
* **Critical Security Issue**: Product search functionality lacks nonce verification and capability checks
* **Limited Functionality**: Current offer system is too basic for professional use
* **Poor User Experience**: No guided workflow for campaign creation
* **Missing Analytics**: Limited insights into offer performance
* **Scalability Issues**: Architecture doesn't support complex campaign scenarios
* **Performance Problems**: No caching system and inefficient database queries

## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 New Campaign-Based Structure
Transform from simple "offers" to comprehensive "campaigns" with:
* **Campaign Types**: Checkout, Cart, Product Page, Exit-Intent, Post-Purchase
* **Campaign Wizard**: Step-by-step guided creation process
* **Template System**: Pre-built campaign templates for common scenarios
* **A/B Testing**: Built-in split testing capabilities

├── CampaignTypes (Checkout, Cart, Product, Exit-Intent, Post-Purchase)
├── CampaignWizard (Guided creation interface)
├── SecurityManager (Comprehensive security framework)
├── CacheManager (Intelligent caching system)
├── AnalyticsManager (Advanced tracking and reporting)
└── TemplateEngine (Campaign template system)
```

### 3.3 Database Schema Evolution

## 4. Critical Security Fixes (Phase 1 - Priority: URGENT)

### 4.1 Product Search Security (CRITICAL)
**Current Problem**: Product search AJAX handler lacks basic security
```php
// CURRENT VULNERABLE CODE:
public function search_products_ajax() {
    // ❌ Missing nonce verification
    // ❌ Missing capability checks  
    // ❌ No rate limiting
    $query = sanitize_text_field($_POST['query'] ?? '');
}
```

**Required Solution**:
* Implement proper nonce verification for all AJAX calls
* Add capability checks (`edit_products` or `manage_woocommerce`)
* Implement rate limiting (30 requests per minute per user)
* Use WooCommerce native Data Store instead of manual queries
* Add comprehensive error handling and logging
* Cache search results for 5 minutes to improve performance

### 4.2 SecurityManager Implementation
Create comprehensive security framework:
* **Nonce Management**: Unique nonces for each AJAX action
* **Capability Verification**: Granular permission checking
* **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of AJAX endpoints
* **Input Sanitization**: Robust data cleaning for all inputs
* **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use prepared statements exclusively
* **XSS Protection**: Proper output escaping throughout

### 4.3 Data Validation Framework
* **Campaign Data Sanitization**: Validate all campaign configuration inputs
* **JSON Schema Validation**: Ensure campaign settings follow defined structure
* **File Upload Security**: Secure handling of campaign media uploads
* **API Input Validation**: Comprehensive REST API input validation
