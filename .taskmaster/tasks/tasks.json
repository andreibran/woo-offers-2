Robust Multi-Layer Validation:**\n- A comprehensive validation engine ensures offers are only applied when all conditions are met.\n- `validate_offer_usage_limits()`: Checks global and per-user usage limits.\n- `validate_user_eligibility()`: Validates user roles and email restrictions.\n- `validate_cart_conditions()`: Enforces minimum/maximum cart value and item quantity rules.\n- `validate_coupon_compatibility()`: Prevents conflicts with other coupons, especially those marked as 'individual use'.\n- `can_apply_offer()`: A centralized function that orchestrates all validation checks before application.\n\n**3. Advanced Duplicate Prevention:**\n- A robust tracking system using `$applied_offers` and `$programmatic_coupons` class properties prevents the same offer from being applied multiple times.\n- Pre-application checks are performed using `is_offer_applied()`.\n- The `woocommerce_coupon_is_valid` filter is used for continuous validation, ensuring invalid coupons are automatically removed from the cart in real-time.\n\n**4. Enhanced Compatibility & Advanced Features:**\n- Respects the `individual_use` flag on other coupons to prevent conflicts.\n- Utilizes native WooCommerce hooks with appropriate priorities for maximum compatibility with other plugins.\n- Implemented a smart auto-apply feature (`auto_apply_eligible_offers()`) for improved user experience.\n- Added manual application and removal functions (`manually_apply_offer()`, `remove_applied_offer()`).\n- A recursion prevention flag was added to optimize performance and prevent infinite loops during coupon validation.",

        "details": "The core issue was that metaboxes were being registered too late in the WordPress admin page lifecycle, inside the page rendering function instead of during the dedicated `add_meta_boxes` action. Additionally, a naming inconsistency prevented the template from correctly displaying the registered boxes.\n\n**Fixes Implemented:**\n1. **Corrected Hook Registration:** In `src/Admin/Admin.php`, the `register_offer_metaboxes` method is now correctly hooked to the `add_meta_boxes` action. The direct call from `create_offer_page()` was removed.\n2. **Added Page Context Check:** The `register_offer_metaboxes` method was updated to check the current admin page (`$_GET['page']`), ensuring metaboxes are only registered on the relevant 'Create Offer' screen (`woo-offers-create`).\n3. **Resolved Naming Inconsistency:** In `templates/admin/edit-offer.php`, the screen ID used in `do_meta_boxes()` and `postboxes.add_postbox_toggles()` was corrected from `woo-offers-edit` to `woo_offers_edit` to match the registration ID. A call to render metaboxes in the 'side' context was also added.",
        "testStrategy": "1. Caches were cleared.\n2. Navigated to the WordPress admin dashboard -> \"Offers\" -> \"Add New\".\n3. **Verification:** Confirmed that all metaboxes (\"General Settings,\" \"Products,\" \"Appearance,\" \"Media & Preview\") are now visible and functional on the \"Create Offer\" screen.\n4. Created a new offer, saved data, and published.\n5. Edited the new offer.\n6. **Verification:** Confirmed metaboxes are also present on the \"Edit Offer\" screen with data correctly loaded.\n7. Confirmed no JavaScript errors in the developer console on either screen.",
