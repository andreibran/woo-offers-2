# üö® CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PATH RESTRICTION

## **OFFICIAL PLUGIN DIRECTORY ONLY**
**ALL CODE CHANGES MUST BE MADE EXCLUSIVELY IN:**
```
C:\Users\Andrei\Downloads\Vibe Coding\woo-offers-2\
```

## **‚ùå NEVER EDIT FILES IN:**
- Local WordPress installations
- wp-content/plugins/woo-offers/ (any WordPress site)
- Staging environments  
- Production environments
- Any copied/symlinked versions
- Any other directory paths

## **‚úÖ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### **1. Official Source**
- **Edit files in:** `C:\Users\Andrei\Downloads\Vibe Coding\woo-offers-2\`
- **Commit changes from:** Official directory only
- **Version control:** Only track official directory

### **2. Testing Process**
1. **Make changes in official directory**
2. **Copy/sync to Local WordPress** for testing
3. **Debug and identify issues** in Local
4. **Return to official directory** to implement fixes
5. **Never edit files directly in Local**

### **3. File Synchronization**
```bash
# Copy from official to Local (example)
# Source: C:\Users\Andrei\Downloads\Vibe Coding\woo-offers-2\
# Target: Local WordPress wp-content/plugins/woo-offers/

# Always copy FROM official TO testing environment
# Never the reverse!
```

## **üîí SAFETY CHECKS**

### **Before Making ANY Code Changes:**
1. ‚úÖ **Verify current working directory is official path**
2. ‚úÖ **Check that file paths contain:** `C:\Users\Andrei\Downloads\Vibe Coding\woo-offers-2\`
3. ‚úÖ **Confirm NOT editing in:** `wp-content/plugins/` or similar paths

### **File Path Validation**
When editing files, ALWAYS verify the path:
```
CORRECT: C:\Users\Andrei\Downloads\Vibe Coding\woo-offers-2\src\Admin\Admin.php
WRONG:   C:\Users\Andrei\Local Sites\site-name\app\public\wp-content\plugins\woo-offers\src\Admin\Admin.php
WRONG:   Any path containing "wp-content/plugins/"
WRONG:   Any path containing "Local Sites"
```

## **üö´ ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS**

### **NEVER:**
- Edit files in WordPress installations (Local, staging, production)
- Make changes in wp-content/plugins/ directories
- Modify files in testing environments directly
- Create fixes outside the official directory
- Commit changes from non-official locations

### **ALWAYS:**
- Work in the official directory: `C:\Users\Andrei\Downloads\Vibe Coding\woo-offers-2\`
- Copy TO testing environments (not FROM them)
- Make all code changes in official source
- Test by copying updated files to Local
- Keep official directory as single source of truth

## **‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR HANDLING WORKFLOW**

### **When Debugging Errors from Local:**
1. **Identify the error** from Local WordPress logs/messages
2. **Locate the problematic file** in the official directory
3. **Make the fix** in the official directory version
4. **Copy the fixed file** to Local for testing
5. **Repeat** until issue resolved
6. **Commit changes** from official directory only

### **NEVER:**
- Fix the file directly in Local and forget to update official
- Edit both versions and lose track of changes
- Make temporary fixes in Local that don't get ported back

## **üîß DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS**

### **Always Run From Official Directory:**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Andrei\Downloads\Vibe Coding\woo-offers-2"

# Git operations
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Description"
git push

# Composer operations  
composer install
composer update

# Build operations
npm run build
```

## **üìã CHECKLIST FOR EVERY EDIT**

Before editing ANY file:
- [ ] Current directory is official plugin path
- [ ] File path contains `C:\Users\Andrei\Downloads\Vibe Coding\woo-offers-2\`
- [ ] NOT editing in wp-content/plugins/ anywhere
- [ ] NOT editing in Local Sites directory
- [ ] Changes will be made in official source only

**üéØ REMEMBER: Official directory is the ONLY source of truth!**
**All other locations are for testing purposes only!**
